# ev3RobotMazerunner

This project involved creating the code for a Python-run ev3 robot to successfully navigate a maze using only a proximity sensor, find a target object and transport the object back to the entrance of the maze using a clamp mechanism installed on the robot.

The purpose of this project is to simulate a rescue robot that could be deployed in the event of a natural disaster to rescue people and animals in situations where rescuers are unable to access or would be exposed to danger attempting to reach a location.
